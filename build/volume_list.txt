Registering graphics systems...

You have successfully registered the following graphics systems.
Registered graphics systems are:
  ASCIITree (ATree)
  DAWNFILE (DAWNFILE)
  G4HepRepFile (HepRepFile)
  RayTracer (RayTracer)
  VRML2FILE (VRML2FILE)
  gMocrenFile (gMocrenFile)

You may choose a graphics system (driver) with a parameter of
the command "/vis/open" or "/vis/sceneHandler/create",
or you may omit the driver parameter and choose at run time:
- by argument in the construction of G4VisExecutive;
- by environment variable "G4VIS_DEFAULT_DRIVER";
- by entry in "~/.g4session";
- by build flags.
- Note: This feature is not allowed in batch mode.
For further information see "examples/basic/B1/exampleB1.cc"
and "vis.mac".

Visualization verbosity is now errors (2)
G4ASCIITree verbosity now 14
G4ASCIITreeSceneHandler::BeginModeling: writing to G4 standard output (G4cout)
#  Set verbosity with "/vis/ASCIITree/verbose <verbosity>":
#    <  10: notifies but does not print details of repeated volumes.
#    >= 10: prints all physical volumes (touchables).
#  The level of detail is given by verbosity%10:
#    >=  0: physical volume name.
#    >=  1: logical volume name (and names of sensitive detector and readout geometry, if any).
#    >=  2: solid name and type.
#    >=  3: volume and density.
#    >=  5: daughter-subtracted volume and mass.
#    >=  6: physical volume dump.
#    >=  7: polyhedron dump.
#  and in the summary at the end of printing:
#    >=  4: daughter-included mass of top physical volume(s) in scene to depth specified.
#  Note: by default, culling is switched off so all volumes are seen.
#  Note: the mass calculation takes into account daughters, which can be time consuming.  If you want the mass of a particular subtree try:
#    /vis/drawTree <subtree-physical-volume-name>
#  Or if you want more control, for example:
#    /vis/open ATree
#    /vis/ASCIITree/verbose 14
#    /vis/scene/create
#    /vis/scene/add/volume <subtree-physical-volume-name> ! <depth>
#    /vis/sceneHandler/attach
#    /vis/viewer/flush
#  Note: dumping the physical volumes produces a lot of output. It is advisable to select the volume of interest, as for a sub-tree above.
#  Now printing with verbosity 14
#  Format is: PV:n / LV (SD,RO) / Solid(type), volume, density
#  Abbreviations: PV = Physical Volume,     LV = Logical Volume,
#                 SD = Sensitive Detector,  RO = Read Out Geometry.
